title: "Exploration of D-Cliques Variations and Edges Cases for Decentralized Federated Learning"
excerpt: "Research Project, 90/100, 2021 <br>Researched the decentralized implementation of a Federated Learning algorithm in the Scalable Computing Systems Laboratory at EPFL. Supervised by Prof. Karmarec, I explored and identify the computational implications of a Decentralized approach to a state-of-the-art topology (D-Cliques) in a research environment. D-Cliques (Bellet et al. 2021) is a recent approach to coordinate and structure a network for DFL. While a fully connected topology is not practical due to the number of edges increasing quadratically, D-Cliques provide an intuitive approach in providing locally fully connected neighborhoods."
