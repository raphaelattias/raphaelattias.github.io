title: "Towards Robust and Adaptable Diagnosis of Pneumonia from Chest X-ray Data"
excerpt: "Visual Intelligence, 90/100, 2021 <br> Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers and radiologists have recently reported AI systems that accurately diagnose pneumonia from a chest X-Ray images using deep neural networks when trained on a sufficient large and homogeneous amount of labelled images.
    However, the robustness and adaptability of these systems, trained minimizing the empirical risk (ERM), remains far way. In fact, ERM have no way of discard environment specific  features creating an alarming situation in which the systems appear accurate, but fail when tested in new hospitals. "
