**Digital Education, 100/100, Best Class Project, 2021** <br> This report is a study about memorisation. Memorisation is a task that is often required during schooling to master various skills, it is often used to speed up a task by quickly retrieving an
information of our memory instead of looking for it on an external knowledge source. This study
specifically compares two different ways to make a student memorize flags and countries, which are
essentially pairs of word-image. There exists two groups, the first will get the help of a teacher
whereas the second group will be split into pairs of students for them to cooperate.
