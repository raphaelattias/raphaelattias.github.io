**Internship, 2022**<br> Currently, I am working as a research and software intern at NEC Laboratories in Princeton, a brilliant research company along with world-renowned scientists. I have implemented and researched the various techniques of data augmentation to improve results on a complex multi-class segmentation problem. In the Medical Machine Learning department, I motivated the use of GANs to produce new samples for cancer detection, and explored the use of self-supervised method such as MixMatch.
