**Internship, 2022**<br> In 2022, I have worked  as a research & software intern at NEC Laboratories in Princeton, a brilliant research company along with world-renowned scientists. I have implemented and researched the various techniques of data augmentation to improve results on a complex multi-class segmentation problem. In the Medical Machine Learning department, I motivated the use of GANs to produce new samples for cancer detection, explored the use of self-supervised method such as MixMatch, and studied ways to make model more robust to domain generalization.
