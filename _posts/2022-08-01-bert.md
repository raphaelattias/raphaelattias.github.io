**Personal Project, 2022**<br> This project has for purpose to practice the full pipeline of solving a problem using modern MLOPS tools. The pre-trained BERT weights have been fine-tuned on a sentimental analysis task on the iMDB dataset. Logging and hyper-parameter tunning has been done using W&B. A Docker image is available for production and deployment is done using Ray Serve to obtain a REST API.
