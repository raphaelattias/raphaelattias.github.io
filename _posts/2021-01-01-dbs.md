**Databases Systems, 82/100, 2021** <br> In this project we design the database schema and implement the relational schema, load the data into a DBMS, evaluate and optimize queries with query plan analysis in order to analyze the performance impact in Oracle SQL. The dataset contains a subset of data from the California Highway Patrol collected from the Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System (SWITRS), covering traffic collisions in the state of California in 2018. These reports have been collected by the Highway Patrol, recorded electronically for archival and preservation based on the forms filed by officers. This data has an immense value for urban planners and scientists that may want to analyze risks and how to improve the traffic situation and which factors or locations may be prevalent.
