**Applied Data Analysis class, 100/100** <br> During this semester long project, we studied in a group of 4 the fluctuation of the Apple stock price, volume and its relationship with quotes in media. Using Yahoo API, Quotebank Dataset and web parsing, we show a visible and quantifiable correlation in Apple coverage and the price of its stock. This project contains a full introduction of the datasets, a study of meaningful events in Apple recent history and a fitted time series prediction taking into account the multiple results of the project. The results have been presented on an interactive website, which required knowledge in data visualization to tell our data story.
