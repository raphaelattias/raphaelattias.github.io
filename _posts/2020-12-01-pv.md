**Machine Learning, 100/100, 2021** <br> Won the 2nd place for best project presentation, presented at the CISBAT 2021 and published in the Journal of Physics. With Prof. Castello, we worked on Deep-learning for the detection of available for solar panel installation from satellite images. This computer vision problem relied on U-net architecture of neural networks done in Pytorch, and reached state of the art performance.
