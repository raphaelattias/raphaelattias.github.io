**Labs in Data Science, 100/100, Best Class Project, 2021** <br> Developed and deployed a journey planner using Spark to compute and visualize the best transportation and path using Zurich Transportation System. Using CFF data, we built a predictive model that solved efficiently the transportation problem. Given a desired arrival time, our route planner will compute the fastest route between departure and arrival stops within a provided confidence tolerance expressed as interquartiles. For instance, "what route from A to B is the fastest at least Q% of the time if I want to arrive at B before instant T". We used the Connection Scan Algorithm, handled data with and Hive PySpark and presented resutls with ipywidget.
