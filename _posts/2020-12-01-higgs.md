**Machine Learning, 100/100, 2020** <br> The task of the Challenge was to predict whether a collision event can generate a Higgs boson, an elementary particle in the Standard Model of physics, or not. In fact, scientists cannot really observe this particle, but only its decay signature through different measurements. We analyzed, preprocessed, transformed those decay signatures and use them as features in our Machine Learning algorithms. Furthermore we present the 6 models that we built and how we selected the best one with the best parameters combining Grid Search and Cross Validation. In a competing against another 200 teams, we reached the 7th rank on AICrowd.
