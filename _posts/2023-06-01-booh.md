## Chi-Square Test of Independence


*TL;DR: We explored the relationship between birth location and various categorical variables using the Chi-Square Test of Independence. The analysis reveals significant associations between race, ethnicity, and primary language with the choice of birth location. However, no significant association is found between pregnancy complications and birth location.*

This test is used to determine if there is a significant association between two categorical variables. In our case, we can create a Rx2 contingency table where one axis represents the location of birth (in hospital or out of hospital) and the other axis represents whether there was a birth complication (yes or no). Then, we can apply the Chi-Square Test to determine if the occurrence of birth complications is independent of the location of birth.

### Interpretation:

* Chi-Square Value: A larger value indicates a greater difference between the observed counts and what would be expected if the variables were independent.

* P-Value: Tells you whether or not the association is statistically significant. Typically, if the p-value is less than 0.05, we might conclude that there is a significant association between the variables.

* Degrees of Freedom: This is equal to (number of rows - 1) x (number of columns - 1) in the contingency table. It helps in determining the critical value for the chi-square distribution.

For interpretation, we would usually focus on the P-Value. If it's below a significance level (commonly 0.05), it suggests that the observed distribution is significantly different from what you'd expect if the variables were independent, indicating an association.

For the variable `Race`, `Ethnicity` and `PrimaryLanguage`, the very low p-value indicates that there is a statistically significant association between race and whether the birth occurred in or out of the hospital. This suggests that race and the language might play a role in the choice or circumstances of the birth location.

For the variable `PregnancyComplications`, the p-value is much greater than 0.05, suggesting that there is no statistically significant association between pregnancy complications and birth location. Pregnancy complications do not appear to be a determining factor in whether a birth occurs in or out of the hospital.

On the figure bellow you can see the bar plots of the various variables against the birth locations. We highlight the correlation between `OutOfHospital` with `Race`, `Ethnicity` and `PrimaryLanguage`.
